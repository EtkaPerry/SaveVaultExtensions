# Security Policy

_Last updated: May 26, 2025_

## Introduction

At Save Vault, we take the security of your data very seriously. This security policy outlines the measures we take to protect your information and the steps you can take to help keep your account secure. Please note that your actual game save files are never uploaded or stored on our servers - they remain exclusively on your computer.

## Data Protection

We implement the following security measures to protect your data:
- Secure password storage using industry-standard hashing algorithms
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Data backups stored securely
- Strict access controls for system administrators

## Local Save Storage

A key security benefit of Save Vault is that we never upload your actual game save files:
- All game save files remain stored exclusively on your local device
- We only store metadata about your saves (such as game names and file locations)
- This approach ensures maximum security for your actual game data
- Your save files cannot be compromised through our service since they never leave your computer

## Account Security

To help maintain the security of your account, we recommend the following practices:
- Use a strong, unique password for your Save Vault account
- Keep your email account secure, as it can be used for account recovery
- Be cautious of phishing attempts that may target your Save Vault account
- Log out of your account when using shared or public computers

## Data Breach Response

- Promptly investigate the incident to determine its scope and impact
- Take immediate steps to contain and remediate the breach
- Notify affected users as required by applicable laws and regulations
